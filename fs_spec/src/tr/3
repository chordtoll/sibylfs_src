rename /tmp_dir_306/d1/nonempty_dir1/f1.txt /tmp_dir_306/d1/nonexist_dir1/
[ENOTDIR]

POSIX says

    [ENOTDIR] [CX] A component of either path prefix names an existing
    file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory;
    
NA
    
    or the old argument names a directory and the new argument names a
    non-directory file;

NA

    or the old argument contains at least one non-
    <slash> character and ends with one or more trailing <slash>
    characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that
    is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory;

NA

    or the old
    argument names an existing non-directory file and the new argument
    names a nonexistent file, contains at least one non- <slash>
    character, and ends with one or more trailing <slash> characters; 

Yes, this is applicable

FIXME note the requirement that "the new argument ... contains at least one non-<slash> character. This implies that

rename f1.txt nonexist_dir1/ should not fail with ENOTDIR

    or
    the new argument names an existing non-directory file, contains at
    least one non- <slash> character, and ends with one or more trailing
    <slash> characters.
