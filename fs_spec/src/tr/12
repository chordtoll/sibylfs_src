OS_CALL(Pid 1,link /tmp_dir_47// /tmp_dir_47//d1/nonexist_dir1/)
[ENOENT]

This looks like a reasonable path error to return. At the moment, we
are not clear about whether path resolution should look at the last
component or not.

However, the specification of link says (and none apply):

## [ENOENT] reconciled

> A component of either path prefix does not exist; 

ENOENT:1

> the file named by path1 does not exist; 

ENOENT:2

> or path1 or path2 points to an empty string.

ENOENT:3

So it looks like this is Linux specific behaviour.
