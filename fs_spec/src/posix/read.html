<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concurrent reads, to special files</p>
<p>Concurrent reads on a normal file are expected to return data (as one might imagine)?</p>
<p>What about a read and a concurrent write?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the read() function may detect and return errors as described below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ordering requirement - presumably &quot;detect existing error&quot;. Note &quot;may&quot;</p>
<p>Does this have any impact on the spec? The intent seems to be that, if nbyte is zero, any errors that may apply are actually thrown and the state is unchaged. I think that is what we currently have in the spec. We must ensure that we preserve (in future spec modifications) that if nbyte is 0, then no state change occurs (e.g. no timestamps updated).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read() function shall return zero and have no other results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NB &quot;no other results&quot; - even timestamps, (but presumably not undefined, implementation defined etc ?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read() shall start at a position in the file given by the file offset associated with fildes. The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offset gets incremented</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA Files that do not support seeking-for example, terminals-always read from the current position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terimnals</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of a file offset associated with such a file is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Undefined means that it is incorrect to attempt to get hold of this information (so somehow we would need to track this).</p>
<p>FIXME Do symlinks support seeking? What about opening? Do symlinks have offsets?</p>
<p>http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Symbolic-Links.html - &quot;You can also make a symbolic link to a name which is not the name of any file. (Opening this link will fail until a file by that name is created.) ... The open function realizes you have specified the name of a link, reads the file name contained in the link, and opens that file name instead.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned. If the file refers to a device special file, the result of subsequent read() requests is implementation-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Special files</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:</p>
<p>If no process has the pipe open for writing, read() shall return 0 to indicate end-of-file.</p>
<p>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].</p>
<p>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is clear, read() shall block the calling thread until some data is written or the pipe is closed by all processes that had the pipe open for writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pipes, FIFOs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that supports non-blocking reads and has no data currently available:</p>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].</p>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, read() shall block the calling thread until some data becomes available.</p>
<p>The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FIXME what are we doing regarding blocking reads?</p>
<p>http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Open_002dtime-Flags.html - glibc says &quot;O_NONBLOCK This prevents open from blocking for a “long time” to open the file. This is only meaningful for some kinds of files, usually devices such as serial ports; when it is not meaningful, it is harmless and ignored. Often opening a port to a modem blocks until the modem reports carrier detection; if O_NONBLOCK is specified, open will return immediately without a carrier.</p>
<p>Note that the O_NONBLOCK flag is overloaded as both an I/O operating mode and a file name translation flag. This means that specifying O_NONBLOCK in open also sets nonblocking I/O mode; see Operating Modes. To open the file without blocking but do normal I/O that blocks, you must call open with O_NONBLOCK set and then call fcntl to turn the bit off.&quot;</p>
<p>N.B. The point is that O_NONBLOCK in open oflags means &quot;don't block on the open, AND set the I/O mode to O_NONBLOCK&quot;</p>
<p>Using fcntl can alter the flags from the initial oflags, but we don't currently model fcntl</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The read() function reads data previously written to a file. If any portion of a regular file prior to the end-of-file has not been written, read() shall return bytes with value 0. For example, lseek() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads in the gap between the previous end of data and the newly written data shall return bytes with value 0 until data is written into the gap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FIXME lseek? should we model this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and shall return the number of bytes read. This number shall never be greater than nbyte. The value returned may be less than nbyte if the number of bytes left in the file is less than nbyte, if the read() request was interrupted by a signal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer than nbyte bytes immediately available for reading. For example, a read() from a file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this does not preclude that the value may be less than nbyte for some other reason. For example, we may be in O_NONBLOCK, and only return the remaining bytes in the current block.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA If a read() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any data, it shall return -1 with errno set to [EINTR].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Signals</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA If a read() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it shall return the number of bytes read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PARA For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with fildes.</p>

<p>PARA [SIO] If the O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity completion. If the O_SYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PARA [OB XSR] A read() from a STREAMS file can read data in three different modes: byte-stream mode, message-nondiscard mode, and message-discard mode. The default shall be byte-stream mode. This can be changed using the I_SRDOPT ioctl() request, and can be tested with I_GRDOPT ioctl(). In byte-stream mode, read() shall retrieve data from the STREAM until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until there is no more data to be retrieved. Byte-stream mode ignores message boundaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, read() shall retrieve data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until a message boundary is reached. If read() does not retrieve all the data in a message, the remaining data shall be left on the STREAM, and can be retrieved by the next read() call. Message-discard mode also retrieves data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or a message boundary is reached. However, unread data remaining in a message after the read() returns shall be discarded, and shall not be available for a subsequent read(), getmsg(), or getpmsg() call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA How read() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by the current read mode setting. In byte-stream mode, read() shall accept data until it has read nbyte bytes, or until there is no more data to read, or until a zero-byte message block is encountered. The read() function shall then return the number of bytes read, and place the zero-byte message back on the STREAM to be retrieved by the next read(), getmsg(), or getpmsg(). In message-nondiscard mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte message shall return 0 and the message shall be removed from the STREAM. When a zero-byte message is read as the first message on a STREAM, the message shall be removed from the STREAM and 0 shall be returned, regardless of the read mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA A read() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message at the front of the STREAM head read queue, regardless of the priority band of the message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a read() from a STREAMS file can only process messages that contain a data part but do not contain a control part. The read() shall fail if a message containing a control part is encountered at the STREAM head. This default action can be changed by placing the STREAM in either control-data mode or control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT ioctl() command. In control-data mode, read() shall convert any control part to data and pass it to the application before passing any data part originally present in the same message. In control-discard mode, read() shall discard message control parts but return to the process any data part in the message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA In addition, read() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value of errno shall not reflect the result of read(), but reflect the prior error. If a hangup occurs on the STREAM being read, read() shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XSR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The pread() function shall be equivalent to read(), except that it shall read from a given position in the file without changing the file pointer. The first three arguments to pread() are the same as read() with the addition of a fourth argument offset for the desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a pread() on a file that is incapable of seeking shall result in an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FIXME which files are incapable of seeking? Terminals only?</p>
