Note also that the ints must be positive.

Later we have:

> EAGAIN may be same as EWOULDBLOCK
> ENOTSUP may be same as EOPNOTSUPP

There is a question: what does it mean when a function specifies that
a given error message may be returned, and another error message with
the same representation may be returned under different (mutually
disjoint) conditions?
