#### NAME

> sys/stat.h - data returned by the stat() function

#### SYNOPSIS

> `#include <sys/stat.h>`

#### DESCRIPTION

> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the structure of the data
> returned by the
> [*fstat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fstat.html),
> [*lstat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lstat.html),
> and
> [*stat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/stat.html)
> functions.
>
> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the **stat** structure, which
> shall include at least the following members:
>
>     dev_t st_dev            Device ID of device containing file. 
>     ino_t st_ino            File serial number. 
>     mode_t st_mode          Mode of file (see below). 
>     nlink_t st_nlink        Number of hard links to the file. 
>     uid_t st_uid            User ID of file. 
>     gid_t st_gid            Group ID of file. 
>     [XSI]
>     dev_t st_rdev           Device ID (if file is character or block special). 
>
>     off_t st_size           For regular files, the file size in bytes. 
>                             For symbolic links, the length in bytes of the 
>                             pathname contained in the symbolic link. 
>     [SHM]
>                             For a shared memory object, the length in bytes. 
>
>     [TYM]
>                             For a typed memory object, the length in bytes. 
>
>                             For other file types, the use of this field is 
>                             unspecified. 
>     struct timespec st_atim Last data access timestamp. 
>     struct timespec st_mtim Last data modification timestamp. 
>     struct timespec st_ctim Last file status change timestamp. 
>     [XSI]
>     blksize_t st_blksize    A file system-specific preferred I/O block size 
>                             for this object. In some file system types, this 
>                             may vary from file to file. 
>     blkcnt_t st_blocks      Number of blocks allocated for this object. 
>
> The *st\_ino* and *st\_dev* fields taken together uniquely identify
> the file within the system.
>
> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the
> **dev\_t**, **ino\_t**, **mode\_t**, **nlink\_t**, **uid\_t**,
> **gid\_t**, **off\_t**, and **time\_t** types as described in
> *\<sys/types.h\>*.
>
> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the **timespec** structure as
> described in [*\<time.h\>*].
> Times shall be given in seconds since the Epoch.
>
> Which structure members have meaningful values depends on the type of
> file. For further information, see the descriptions of
> [*fstat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fstat.html),
> [*lstat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lstat.html),
> and
> [*stat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/stat.html)
> in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2008.
>
> For compatibility with earlier versions of this standard, the
> *st\_atime* macro shall be defined with the value *st\_atim.tv\_sec*.
> Similarly, *st\_ctime* and *st\_mtime* shall be defined as macros with
> the values *st\_ctim.tv\_sec* and *st\_mtim.tv\_sec*, respectively.  
>
> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the following symbolic
> constants for the file types encoded in type **mode\_t**. The values
> shall be suitable for use in **\#if** preprocessing directives:
>
> S\_IFMT  
> Type of file.
>
> S\_IFBLK  
> Block special.
>
> S\_IFCHR  
> Character special.
>
> S\_IFIFO  
> FIFO special.
>
> S\_IFREG  
> Regular.
>
> S\_IFDIR  
> Directory.
>
> S\_IFLNK  
> Symbolic link.
>
> S\_IFSOCK  
> Socket.
>
>
> The *\<sys/stat.h\>* header shall define the following symbolic
> constants for the file mode bits encoded in type **mode\_t**, with the
> indicated numeric values. These macros shall expand to an expression
> which has a type that allows them to be used, either singly or OR'ed
> together, as the third argument to
> *open*()
> without the need for a **mode\_t** cast. The values shall be suitable
> for use in **\#if** preprocessing directives.

*The following sections are informative.*

#### APPLICATION USAGE

> Use of the macros is recommended for determining the type of a file.

#### RATIONALE

> A conforming C-language application must include *\<sys/stat.h\>* for
> functions that have arguments or return values of type **mode\_t**, so
> that symbolic values for that type can be used. An alternative would
> be to require that these constants are also defined by including
> [*\<sys/types.h\>*](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_types.h.html).
>
> The S\_ISUID and S\_ISGID bits may be cleared on any write, not just
> on
> [*open*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html),
> as some historical implementations do.
>
> System calls that update the time entry fields in the **stat**
> structure must be documented by the implementors. POSIX-conforming
> systems should not update the time entry fields for functions listed
> in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2008 unless the standard
> requires that they do, except in the case of documented extensions to
> the standard.
>
> Upon assignment, file timestamps are immediately converted to the
> resolution of the file system by truncation (i.e., the recorded time
> can be older than the actual time). For example, if the file system
> resolution is 1 microsecond, then a conforming
> [*stat*()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/stat.html)
> must always return an *st\_mtim.tv\_nsec* that is a multiple of 1000.
> Some older implementations returned higher-resolution timestamps while
> the *inode* information was cached, and then spontaneously truncated
> the *tv\_nsec* fields when they were stored to and retrieved from
> disk, but this behavior does not conform.
>
> Note that *st\_dev* must be unique within a Local Area Network (LAN)
> in a \`\`system'' made up of multiple computers' file systems
> connected by a LAN.
>
> Networked implementations of a POSIX-conforming system must guarantee
> that all files visible within the file tree (including parts of the
> tree that may be remotely mounted from other machines on the network)
> on each individual processor are uniquely identified by the
> combination of the *st\_ino* and *st\_dev* fields.
>
> The unit for the *st\_blocks* member of the **stat** structure is not
> defined within POSIX.1-2008. In some implementations it is 512 bytes.
> It may differ on a file system basis. There is no correlation between
> values of the *st\_blocks* and *st\_blksize*, and the *f\_bsize* (from
> [*\<sys/statvfs.h\>*](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_statvfs.h.html))
> structure members.
>
> Traditionally, some implementations defined the multiplier for
> *st\_blocks* in
> [*\<sys/param.h\>*](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_param.h.html)
> as the symbol DEV\_BSIZE.
>
> Some earlier versions of this standard did not specify values for the
> file mode bit macros. The expectation was that some implementors might
> choose to use a different encoding for these bits than the traditional
> one, and that new applications would use symbolic file modes instead
> of numeric. This version of the standard specifies the traditional
> encoding, in recognition that nearly 20 years after the first
> publication of this standard numeric file modes are still in
> widespread use by application developers, and that all conforming
> implementations still use the traditional encoding.

#### FUTURE DIRECTIONS

> No new S\_IFMT symbolic names for the file type values of **mode\_t**
> will be defined by POSIX.1-2008; if new file types are required, they
> will only be testable through *S\_ISxx()* or *S\_TYPEISxxx()* macros
> instead.
