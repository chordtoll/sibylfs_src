### 4.2 Directory Protection
 
> If a directory is writable and the mode bit S_ISVTX is set on the directory, a process may remove or rename files within that directory only if one or more of the following is true:
> 
>   - The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the file.
> 
>   - The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the directory.
> 
>   - The process has appropriate privileges.
> 
>   - Optionally, the file is writable by the process. Whether or not files that are writable by the process can be removed or renamed is implementation-defined.
> 
> If the S_ISVTX bit is set on a non-directory file, the behavior is unspecified.

### 4.4 File Access Permissions


> The standard file access control mechanism uses the file permission bits, as described below.
> 
> Implementations may provide additional or alternate file access control mechanisms, or both. An additional access control mechanism shall only further restrict the access permissions defined by the file permission bits. An alternate file access control mechanism shall:
> 
>   - Specify file permission bits for the file owner class, file group class, and file other class of that file, corresponding to the access permissions.
> 
>   - Be enabled only by explicit user action, on a per-file basis by the file owner or a user with appropriate privileges.
> 
>   - Be disabled for a file after the file permission bits are changed for that file with chmod(). The disabling of the alternate mechanism need not disable any additional mechanisms supported by an implementation.
> 
> Whenever a process requests file access permission for read, write, or execute/search, if no additional mechanism denies access, access shall be determined as follows:
> 
>   - If a process has appropriate privileges:
> 
>       * If read, write, or directory search permission is requested, access shall be granted.
> 
>       * If execute permission is requested, access shall be granted if execute permission is granted to at least one user by the file permission bits or by an alternate access control mechanism; otherwise, access shall be denied.
> 
>   - Otherwise:
> 
>       * The file permission bits of a file contain read, write, and execute/search permissions for the file owner class, file group class, and file other class.
> 
>       *  Access shall be granted if an alternate access control mechanism is not enabled and the requested access permission bit is set for the class (file owner class, file group class, or file other class) to which the process belongs, or if an alternate access control mechanism is enabled and it allows the requested access; otherwise, access shall be denied.
