# Description

> The write() function shall attempt to write nbyte bytes from the buffer pointed 
> to by buf to the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes.
>
> Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero and
> the file is a regular file, the write() function may detect and return errors as described below.
> In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed,
> the write() function shall return zero and have no other results.
> If nbyte is zero and the file is not a regular file, the results are unspecified.

Times

> Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0,
> write() shall mark for update the last data modification and
> last file status change timestamps of the file,
> and if the file is a regular file, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.

What about the access time?
Likely we have the following situations:
1) Write for new file creation -> the access time is unset
2) Write for file modification -> the access time does not change.
