<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The open() function shall establish the connection between a file and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file description that refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file. The path argument points to a pathname naming the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NB two notions: file descriptor, and open file description; open file descriptions are not accessible to users</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The open() function shall return a file descriptor for the named file that is the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process. The open file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor shall not share it with any other process in the system. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor shall be cleared unless the O_CLOEXEC flag is set in oflag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note &quot;lowest file descriptor...&quot; and &quot;... not currently open&quot;</p>
<p>open file descriptions are for the system as a whole, not per process; fds are per-process</p>
<p><code>FD_CLOEXEC</code> is a flag associated with fds, default cleared</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The file offset used to mark the current position within the file shall be set to the beginning of the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description shall be set according to the value of oflag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oflag controls file status flags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA Values for oflag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>. Applications shall specify exactly one of the first five values (file access modes) below in the value of oflag:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>requirement for bitwise or of flags, but not for particular bits</p>
<p>note &quot;exactly one&quot; of the file access modes</p>
<p>NB this statement says &quot;shall specify&quot;, but below the error EINVAL (for incorrect oflags) is listed under &quot;function may fail&quot;.</p>
<p>Actually, the &quot;shall specify&quot; is a requirement on applications. But this seems nonsensical - POSIX doesn't specify applications, only the library interface. The question is: what is the specification is an application doesn't specify exactly one of the first five values.</p>
<p>The meaning of may is: &quot;Describes a feature or behavior that is optional for an implementation that conforms to POSIX.1-2008. An application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a feature or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.&quot;</p>
<p>So the problem is that there is a strict requirement for oflags to contain exactly one file access mode, but EINVAL is marked as a may, so it is not clear what conformant implementations might return if oflags is incorrect. In fact, EINVAL should probably be marked as a shall fail. And we should treat EINVAL for incorrect oflags as such.</p>
<p>Probable posix spec error. No! The &quot;shall specify&quot; is a requirement on applications. If they do something else, then the result is probably &quot;undefined&quot; (or EINVAL, in the may case).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_EXEC Open for execute only (non-directory files). The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_EXEC:1 Does execute only mean that read and write are prohibited?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_RDONLY Open for reading only.</p>
<p>O_RDWR Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.</p>
<p>O_SEARCH Open directory for search only. The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a non-directory file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_SEARCH:1 Search on a directory means?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_WRONLY Open for writing only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA Any combination of the following may be used:</p>
<p>O_APPEND If set, the file offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to each write.</p>
<p>O_CLOEXEC If set, the FD_CLOEXEC flag for the new file descriptor shall be set.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O_CREAT If the file exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the file shall be created; the user ID of the file shall be set to the effective user ID of the process; the group ID of the file shall be set to the group ID of the file's parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process; and the access permission bits (see <sys/stat.h>) of the file mode shall be set to the value of the argument following the oflag argument</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there are additional arguments beyond oflag</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taken as type mode_t modified as follows: a bitwise AND is performed on the file-mode bits and the corresponding bits in the complement of the process' file mode creation mask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>each process has a file mode creation mask</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, all bits in the file mode whose corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask is set are cleared. When bits other than the file permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>must check for this Notice: for mkdir it sais other bits are implementation defined. Inconsitency in spec?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The argument following the oflag argument does not affect whether the file is open for reading, writing, or for both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>why this explicit statement? why might the argument affect the file open mode?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the file's group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined way to initialize the file's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like there is a choice here: effective group id may not be supported. (Sorted by addition to architecture record)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_DIRECTORY If path resolves to a non-directory file, fail and set errno to [ENOTDIR].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ENOTDIR:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_DSYNC [SIO] Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity completion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O_EXCL If O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, open() shall fail if the file exists. The check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist shall be atomic with respect to other threads executing open() naming the same filename in the same directory with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, and path names a symbolic link, open() shall fail and set errno to [EEXIST], regardless of the contents of the symbolic link.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_NOCTTY If set and path identifies a terminal device, open() shall not cause the terminal device to become the controlling terminal for the process. If path does not identify a terminal device, O_NOCTTY shall be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't currently handle terminal devices</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_NOFOLLOW If path names a symbolic link, fail and set errno to [ELOOP].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELOOP:1</p>
<p>--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_NONBLOCK When opening a FIFO with O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY set: If O_NONBLOCK is set, an open() for reading-only shall return without delay. An open() for writing-only shall return an error if no process currently has the file open for reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't deal with FIFOs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, an open() for reading-only shall block the calling thread until a thread opens the file for writing. An open() for writing-only shall block the calling thread until a thread opens the file for reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is some kind of synchronization between processes. Note that this appears to happen e.g. when reading a file which already exists and contains data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When opening a block special or character special file that supports non-blocking opens:</p>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is set, the open() function shall return without blocking for the device to be ready or available. Subsequent behavior of the device is device-specific.</p>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, the open() function shall block the calling thread until the device is ready or available before returning.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the O_NONBLOCK flag shall not cause an error, but it is unspecified whether the file status flags will include the O_NONBLOCK flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't do block special or character special files.</p>
<p>--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_RSYNC [SIO] Read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete at the same level of integrity as specified by the O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags. If both O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC are set in oflag, all I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity completion. If both O_SYNC and O_RSYNC are set in flags, all I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't do synchronized I/O integrity completion (?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_SYNC [XSI|SIO] Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion. [XSI] The O_SYNC flag shall be supported for regular files, even if the Synchronized Input and Output option is not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O_TRUNC If the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is successfully opened O_RDWR or O_WRONLY, its length shall be truncated to 0, and the mode and owner shall be unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_TRUNC:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It shall have no effect on FIFO special files or terminal device files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_TRUNC:2 FIFO special files, terminal devices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its effect on other file types is implementation-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_TRUNC:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of using O_TRUNC without either O_RDWR or O_WRONLY is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O_TRUNC:4</p>
<p>Opening for readonly, with truncate, is undefined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O_TTY_INIT If path identifies a terminal device other than a pseudo-terminal, the device is not already open in any process, and either O_TTY_INIT is set in oflag or O_TTY_INIT has the value zero, open() shall set any non-standard termios structure terminal parameters to a state that provides conforming behavior; see XBD Parameters that Can be Set. It is unspecified whether O_TTY_INIT has any effect if the device is already open in any process. If path identifies the slave side of a pseudo-terminal that is not already open in any process, open() shall set any non-standard termios structure terminal parameters to a state that provides conforming behavior, regardless of whether O_TTY_INIT is set. If path does not identify a terminal device, O_TTY_INIT shall be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA [SIO] If both the O_SYNC and O_DSYNC flags are set, the effect is as if only the O_SYNC flag was set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>synchronized I/O integrity completion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA [OB XSR] If path refers to a STREAMS file, oflag may be constructed from O_NONBLOCK OR'ed with either O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. Other flag values are not applicable to STREAMS devices and shall have no effect on them. The value O_NONBLOCK affects the operation of STREAMS drivers and certain functions applied to file descriptors associated with STREAMS files. For STREAMS drivers, the implementation of O_NONBLOCK is device-specific.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STREAMS?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The application shall ensure that it specifies the O_TTY_INIT flag on the first open of a terminal device since system boot or since the device was closed by the process that last had it open. The application need not specify the O_TTY_INIT flag when opening pseudo-terminals. [XSI] If path names the master side of a pseudo-terminal device, then it is unspecified whether open() locks the slave side so that it cannot be opened. Conforming applications shall call unlockpt() before opening the slave side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>terminals</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type off_t shall be established as the offset maximum in the open file description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>open file descriptions have a field &quot;offset maximum&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The openat() function shall be equivalent to the open() function except in the case where path specifies a relative path. In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor fd instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor was opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>permissions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PARA The oflag parameter and the optional fourth parameter correspond exactly to the parameters of open().</p>
<p>PARA If openat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to open().</p>

<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In historical implementations the value of O_RDONLY is zero. Because of that, it is not possible to detect the presence of O_RDONLY and another option. Future implementations should encode O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY as bit flags so that:</p>
<p>O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY == O_RDWR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that the flags do not correspond to individual bits. Indeed, in fcntl.h we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <fcntl.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as the file access modes for open(), openat(), and fcntl(). The values shall be unique, except that O_EXEC and O_SEARCH may have equal values. The values shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.</p>
<p>O_EXEC Open for execute only (non-directory files). The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a directory. O_RDONLY Open for reading only. O_RDWR Open for reading and writing. O_SEARCH Open directory for search only. The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a non-directory file. O_WRONLY Open for writing only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key phrase here is &quot;values shall be unique&quot;, as opposed to &quot;The values shall be bitwise-distinct&quot; that is used elsewhere in fcntl.h</p>
