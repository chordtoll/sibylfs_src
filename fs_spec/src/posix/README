This directory contains annotated copies of the Open Group online
version of the POSIX specification 2013 Edition, available here:
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/

This allows us to internally comment on the POSIX spec, and provide
references to particular sentences or paragraphs in POSIX. For
example, we use references like `posix/rename.md ENOENT:2` which
refers to the rename.md file in this directory, at the ENOENT:2 label.

In order to make these references public, we need to map references
like `posix/rename.md ENOENT:2` to page and line numbers in the
official C138.pdf (2013 version) of the spec published by the Open
Group. The mapping will be maintained in the file C138_references.txt
