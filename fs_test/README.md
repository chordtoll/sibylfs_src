Files:

  * `check.{ml,native}` - take a trace (e.g. derived from posix
    command) and check that it is accepted by the specification; os
    and fs level; typically used via `fs_test.sh`

  * `default.nix` - build file; type `nix-build` in this directory to
    build using nix

  * `fs_test.{ml,native,sh}` - run collections of test suites against
    various filesystems; `fs_test.sh` is the default entry point

  * `fs_test_version.ml` - version info, typically derived from git
    commit, generated by Makefile
    
  * `Makefile` - build file; type `make` in this directory to build
    using make

  * `posix.{ml,native}` - run test commands against the POSIX C library
    interface; usually accessed via `fs_test.sh`

    The executable `posix.native` provides direct access to
    syscalls. Syscalls can be given on stdin, or processed in batch mode
    from a file. See posix.ml for command line options etc.

    Typical usage: ./posix.native -b -r /tmp/unix_impl_test test_commands

  * `run_trace.{ml,native}` - FIXME

  * `testall.sh` - after making, try to run some very simple tests;
    use this after making changes to the spec to check that things
    aren't messed up too badly.

   * `traces.md` - some high level documentation of traces and 
    how to use them


Subdirectories:

  * `adhoc_tests` - adhoc tests that should be run at the same time as
    the tests automatically generated by `testgen`. 
    
    [ ] incorporate all test scripts into a "main" test script; rename
    directories so that there is no clash with autogenerated test
    script
    
  * `debug` - contains versions of check that produce debugging info,
    to analyse failing traces

  * `docker` - instructions for running tests in a docker container
  
  * `example_traces` - test traces, for checking basic tool
    functionality
  
  * `ld_preload` - some fancy C code for intercepting library calls
    and redirecting them
    
  * `lib` - common test library files
    
  * `paths` - unit tests for path resolution code, module `Resolve` in
    the spec
    
  * `repro` - reproduce buggy filesystem behaviour, using simple C
    code (for upstreaming bug reports)

  * `testgen` - (fairly) exhaustive test generation for each operation
